# Project Improvement Plan

## Project Overview
This is a modern portfolio website built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. It includes features like dark mode, an AI chatbot powered by Claude, and a contact form using EmailJS.

## Review Process

### 1. Assessment Phase
- Review project structure and dependencies
- Analyze key files: package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.ts
- Examine components: Hero, Projects, Contact, ThemeToggle, Chatbot
- Review API routes and global files

### 2. Identified Issues
- Accessibility:
  - Missing alt text on avatar image
  - Form inputs missing proper labels/associations
- Code Quality:
  - Empty animation variants in page.tsx
  - Using array indices as keys in Projects component
- Security:
  - Environment variables used without proper validation
- SEO/Metadata:
  - Limited description in metadata
- Developer Experience:
  - No example environment file

### 3. Proposed Improvements
- Fix accessibility issues
  - Add descriptive alt text to images
  - Properly associate form labels with inputs
- Improve code quality
  - Replace empty animation variants with meaningful ones
  - Add unique IDs to project objects and use them as keys
- Enhance security
  - Add validation for environment variables
- Optimize SEO
  - Improve meta description
- Improve developer experience
  - Create .env.example file

### 4. Implementation Steps
1. Fix accessibility issues in Hero.tsx and Contact.tsx
2. Improve animations in page.tsx
3. Enhance Projects component with proper keys
4. Add environment variable validation in API route
5. Improve metadata in layout.tsx
6. Create .env.example file

### 5. Verification
- Run linter to check for issues
- Run TypeScript compiler to check types
- Test functionality manually
